# ReplaceText
Finds and replaces a phrase in a document with a list of different phrases.\
\
This is also written in Polish and quite in a hurry. That's why there is no graphics interface.\
Anyway, it comes in handy when you need to create many invitations or other documents and you already have a list of guests but don't want to copy and paste those names 60 times for example.\
Solution is to prepare just one page with a keyword or phrase and copy that page quickly without the need of changing that phrase. The program will replace the phrase on each page with the names from the list. The document we need must be named 'Dokument.doc'. The notepad file with the source names must be called 'Dane.txt'. File Dane.txt must be saved in the Unicode format in order for the program to work properly. That's why my phrase includes Å› character. You can use any characters in any language this way.\
To use this program always have Replace Text.jar along with Dane.txt and Dokument.doc. Dane.txt is the source file with the key-phrase in the first line, names to replace the phrase in the next lines and some word in the last line to avoid EOF.\
As I said, the program doesn't have a UI. Just prepare the source file, the destination file and run the program.
